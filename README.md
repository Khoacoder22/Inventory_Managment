# Inventory Management System

This project is an Inventory Management System built using **Spring Boot** for the backend, **MySQL** for database management, and **ReactJS** for the frontend.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot
  - Spring Boot provides a framework to quickly set up a robust and scalable backend.
  - REST API for handling CRUD operations on the inventory data.
  - Security and user authentication with Spring Security.
  
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
  - A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - State management with React Hooks.
  - Uses Axios to interact with the backend API.
  
- **Database**: MySQL
  - MySQL is used to store product inventory data and transaction history.
  - The backend uses JPA and Hibernate for object-relational mapping (ORM) to interact with MySQL.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and secure access to the application.
- **Inventory Management**: Add, update, delete, and view products in the inventory.
- **Transactions**: Record transactions for product sales or purchases.
